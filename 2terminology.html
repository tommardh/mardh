<h1>Terminololgy</h1>
<p>
  The terms listed here might have a formal defenition, or several, 
  but this list are my take on them. They are described from my perspective 
  as an Agile Coach. Sometimes the term normally used is replaced with an
  alternative that creates an association that is more useful.
