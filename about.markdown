My name is Tom MÃ¥rdh and I work as an Agile Coach at Aliby. The purpose with this site is to share my insights as blog posts and a dictionary based upon definitions that I have experienced useful, even if they are not always formally correct or widely adopted.

What about the oak? It feels great to change environment and reflect. It might be in the nature and sometimes I end up sitting under an oak. Doing that gives me a different perspective.
